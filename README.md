# Interview-Problems
This repo holds multiple stand-alone files containing problems with solutions and extensive explanations for potential interview questions. <br />

I am going to put a stronger emphasis on the following topics: <br />
    * Dynamic Programming <br />
    * Memoization <br />
    * Trees <br />
    * Algorithms <br />

All solutions and explanations are created by Ashour Dankha (unless written otherwise). If there is an error in my explanation or code, please let me know! :)


DISCLAIMER: The problems on this repo are problems I feel would be good interview problems. They are not problems I have taken from companies I have interviewed at. Unless granted permission to post a companies interview question, I will never post or mention questions that a company has asked me to do.
