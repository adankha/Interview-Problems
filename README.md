# Interview-Problems
This repo holds multiple stand-alone files containing problems (with solutions) that potentially would be asked during an interview. <br />

I am going to put a stronger emphasis on the following topics: <br />
    * Dynamic Programming <br />
    * Memoization <br />
    * Trees <br />
    * Algorithms <br />
