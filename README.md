# Interview-Problems
This repo holds multiple stand-alone files containing problems (with solutions) that potentially would be asked during an interview.

I am going to put a stronger emphasis on the following topics:
    * Dynamic Programming
    * Memoization (diff than DP!)
    * Trees
    * Algorithms
